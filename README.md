### Here you will find an overview of concepts and learnings that I picked-up on the way....

### [PySpark: Advanced Analytics with Big Data, here we come!](https://andriescoetsee.github.io/Docs/)

* I attended a webinar: Big Data Processing on AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) using Hadoop & Spark.
* Through this webinar I could get a glimpse of the future of big data proccessing in the cloud. 
* Personally, my interest lies in advanced analytics, so I decided to skill up on using Apache Spark as a big data platform.

### [Kaggle: My first competition](https://andriescoetsee.github.io/my_first_kaggle_competition)

* I tried out two ML algorithms: Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regression
* I learnt about the Optuna Python package which is a new hyperparameter optimization tool
* XGBoost is definitely superior in performance in processing time (using GPU) and in prediction accuracy

### [ML overfitting and underfitting](https://andriescoetsee.github.io/ml_overfitting_underfitting/)

* Here I explain the important statistical concepts of overfitting and underfitting in a ML context.

### [Dax Concept: Snapshot & Variance Report](https://andriescoetsee.github.io/dax_snapshot_variance_report) 

![](/images/powerBI_small2.png)

* After completing my Microsoft Power BI certification I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty
* Here I illustrate how I optimised a report using DAX measures

### [Bayes Simulation: Digital Marketing CTR](https://andriescoetsee.github.io/bayes_ctr_simulation/)
![](/images/PyMC3_2.png)
* After completing Bayesian Data Analysis in Python with [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), I tried out posterior analysis on a digital marketing campaign dataset.
* Here I illustrate using different libraries like Numpy, Seaborn and PyMC3, specifically focussing on analysing distributions the Bayesian way.
* Next time I would like to illustrate Bayesian linear regression with PyMC3 and try out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC).

### [Django: My first website](https://github.com/andriescoetsee/my_first_website_Django) 

 ![](/images/django_python_logo_small.png)
 
* This was my first website learning the Django framework. The main functionality was a calendar for scheduling events.
* The website included a REST API to interface with an Android Mobile Application as well as an alerting mechanism through SMS.
* The website was hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) but I have not maintained it since 2018 and decided to terminate the website.

### [Android: My first mobile application](https://github.com/andriescoetsee/my_first_mobile_app_Android) 

 ![](/images/android_logo_small.png)
 
* My first mobile application that worked in conjunction with my first website.
* The mobile application provided information on upcoming events booked in the Calendar.
