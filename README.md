* This was my first website learning the Django framework. The main functionality was a calendar for scheduling events.
* The website included a REST API to interface with an Android Mobile Application as well as an alerting mechanism through SMS.
* The website was hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) but I have not maintained it since 2018 and decided to terminate the website.
